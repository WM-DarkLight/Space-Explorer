# Mapping Dark Matter in the Cosmos

Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of all matter in the universe, yet it remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics.

## The Invisible Universe

Unlike normal matter, dark matter doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force. This means it doesn't absorb, reflect, or emit light, making it extremely difficult to detect directly.

## Detection Methods

Scientists use several methods to map dark matter:

- Gravitational lensing: Observing how light from distant galaxies bends around invisible mass
- Galaxy rotation curves: Measuring how galaxies rotate faster than they should based on visible matter
- Cosmic microwave background: Analyzing tiny fluctuations in the afterglow of the Big Bang

## Recent Discoveries

The Dark Energy Survey and other projects have created detailed maps of dark matter distribution, revealing a cosmic web structure that aligns with computer simulations of how the universe evolved.

These maps are helping scientists understand how galaxies form and how the universe's large-scale structure developed over billions of years.
