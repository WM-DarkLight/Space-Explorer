# The Event Horizon: Where Physics Breaks Down

Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in our universe. At their boundary, called the event horizon, our understanding of physics faces its ultimate test.

## What is an Event Horizon?

The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. It's not a physical surface, but rather a mathematical boundary where the escape velocity equals the speed of light.

## Physics at the Boundary

At the event horizon, several strange phenomena occur:

- Time dilation becomes infinite from an outside observer's perspective
- Light becomes infinitely redshifted
- Quantum effects begin to play a significant role

## Recent Research

Recent observations from the Event Horizon Telescope have given us our first direct images of black hole shadows, confirming many theoretical predictions about these cosmic monsters.

Scientists continue to study how quantum mechanics and general relativity might be reconciled at the event horizon, potentially leading to a theory of quantum gravity.
