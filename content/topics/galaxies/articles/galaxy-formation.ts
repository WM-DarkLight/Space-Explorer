# The Birth and Evolution of Galaxies

Galaxies are vast cosmic cities, home to billions or even trillions of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter.

## Galaxy Formation

Galaxies began forming about 13 billion years ago, not long after the Big Bang. They started as small irregularities in the distribution of matter, which grew through gravity to become the first protogalaxies.

## Types of Galaxies

Astronomers classify galaxies into several main types:

- Spiral galaxies (like our Milky Way)
- Elliptical galaxies
- Irregular galaxies
- Lenticular galaxies

Each type has distinct characteristics and formation histories.

## Galaxy Evolution

Galaxies evolve through:

- Accretion of gas and smaller galaxies
- Star formation and stellar evolution
- Interactions and mergers with other galaxies
- Influence of supermassive black holes at their centers

The James Webb Space Telescope is now providing unprecedented views of the earliest galaxies, helping us understand how these cosmic structures first formed.
